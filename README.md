<p>It's a simple simulation of a smartphone's functionalities, focusing on camera and WiFi capabilities, using object-oriented principles and interface implementation. The MyCam interface outlines camera-related functions, including snapping photos and recording, with a default method to print a greeting and indicate high-quality recording. The WiFi interface specifies methods for retrieving available networks and connecting to a selected network. The MyPhone class represents a basic phone with methods for calling a number and picking up calls.</p>
<hr>
<p>The MySmartPhone class extends MyPhone and implements both MyCam and WiFi interfaces, thus inheriting the phone's basic functionalities while adding camera and WiFi features. It provides concrete implementations for the abstract methods defined in the interfaces. The main method in the TIP class creates an instance of MySmartPhone, utilizes the recordQual method to demonstrate the camera recording quality, and then fetches and prints a list of available WiFi networks.</p>

<p>Overall, this code serves as a demonstration of how multiple interfaces can be implemented in a class to simulate a multi-functional device, showcasing inheritance, method overriding, and interface usage in Java.</p>
